# DREAM.3D-Data-Modeling (i.e., Digital Representation Environment for Analyzing Microstructures in 3D)
see https://github.com/BlueQuartzSoftware/DREAM3D

I have included the codes directly from my PhD Dissertation, which was completed at Wright State University in 2015.
It can be downloaded for free at the following link: https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?::NO:10:P10_ETD_SUBID:107050

Please see "Tutorial_How to Perform Resolution and Noise Analysis on Virtual Microstructures using DREAM3D.pdf" document for a
detailed description of how to perform DREAM.3D analysis of microstructures on your own.

Thanks!
Greg
